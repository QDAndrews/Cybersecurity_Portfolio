1Ô∏è‚É£ Basic Understanding of Networking
Networking is fundamental for security because attacks often involve network-based exploits. You need to understand how data moves across networks, how attackers exploit protocols, and how to monitor network traffic.

üîπ OSI Model (Open Systems Interconnection Model)
The OSI model is a conceptual framework that standardizes network communication. It has 7 layers, and each plays a role in how data is sent and received over networks.

OSI Model Layers (From Layer 1 to Layer 7)
Layer	Name	Purpose	Example Protocols & Devices	Security Considerations
7	Application	User interaction with network services	HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, SMTP, DNS	Web application vulnerabilities (SQL Injection, XSS, CSRF)
6	Presentation	Data translation, encryption, compression	SSL/TLS, JPEG, ASCII	SSL/TLS attacks, insecure data transmission
5	Session	Manages sessions between applications	NetBIOS, RPC, SQL sessions	Session hijacking, unauthorized access
4	Transport	Ensures reliable data delivery (end-to-end communication)	TCP, UDP	Port scanning, DDoS attacks (UDP flood, SYN flood)
3	Network	Routing and addressing (IP addressing, packet forwarding)	IP, ICMP, ARP, OSPF	IP Spoofing, ARP Poisoning, DDoS
2	Data Link	MAC addressing, error detection, and handling frames	Ethernet, Wi-Fi (802.11), VLANs	MAC spoofing, Man-in-the-Middle attacks
1	Physical	Transmission of raw data (electrical signals, radio waves)	Cables, switches, Wi-Fi, fiber optics	Physical security, wiretapping, jamming
üî• Why Security Analysts Need OSI Model Knowledge
Helps troubleshoot security incidents by identifying which layer an attack targets.
Understanding packet flow helps in detecting anomalies in network traffic.
Helps in firewall configuration and network security device placement (IPS/IDS).
üîπ TCP/IP Model (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol Model)
Unlike the OSI model, the TCP/IP model is more practical and used in real-world networking. It has 4 layers (instead of 7).

OSI Model	TCP/IP Model	Key Protocols
Application (7,6,5)	Application	HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, SMTP, SSH, DNS
Transport (4)	Transport	TCP, UDP
Network (3)	Internet	IP, ICMP, ARP, OSPF
Data Link (2) & Physical (1)	Network Access	Ethernet, Wi-Fi, PPP
Key TCP/IP Security Concepts
TCP vs. UDP: TCP ensures reliable communication (used for web traffic, email), while UDP is faster but less reliable (used in gaming, VoIP, and DDoS attacks).
IP Addressing & Subnetting: Helps identify devices in a network and segment networks for better security.
DNS Security: DNS spoofing, DNS hijacking, and how attackers redirect users to malicious websites.
Packet Inspection: How firewalls and IDS/IPS inspect traffic at different layers.
2Ô∏è‚É£ Operating Systems: Windows & Linux
Operating systems are the main attack surface in cybersecurity. A security analyst must understand how each OS works, its security features, and its vulnerabilities.

üîπ Windows Security for Security Analysts
Windows is widely used in enterprises, making it a major target for cyberattacks.

Key Windows Security Topics
Windows File System: NTFS vs. FAT32 (NTFS has better security features like file permissions).
Windows Event Logs: Found in Event Viewer, logs are crucial for security investigations.
Security Log: Tracks login attempts, policy changes.
System Log: Tracks OS events like crashes, reboots.
Application Log: Tracks software-related events.
Active Directory (AD):
Centralized authentication & authorization system in Windows domains.
Kerberos authentication is used to verify users securely.
Common AD Attacks: Pass-the-Hash, Kerberoasting, Golden Ticket attacks.
Windows Defender & Group Policies (GPOs):
GPOs enforce security settings (password policies, software restrictions).
Windows Defender provides built-in endpoint security.
Windows PowerShell & Security:
Used for automation but also exploited by attackers (PowerShell malware, Living-Off-The-Land attacks).
üîπ Linux Security for Security Analysts
Linux is popular for servers, networking, and security tools like Kali Linux.

Key Linux Security Topics
Linux File System & Permissions:
Everything in Linux is a file!
Permissions (rwx, chmod, chown) are key to securing files.
Linux Logging:
Logs stored in /var/log/ (e.g., /var/log/auth.log for authentication events).
User & Group Management:
root is the superuser; use sudo for privilege escalation.
Important Linux Security Commands:
iptables: Firewall settings.
auditd: Tracks system changes.
fail2ban: Blocks brute-force attacks.
chkrootkit & rkhunter: Rootkit detection tools.
3Ô∏è‚É£ Web Applications & Security
Web applications are a primary attack vector since they are accessible over the internet.

üîπ Common Web Security Topics
HTTP vs HTTPS
HTTPS encrypts data using TLS/SSL to prevent eavesdropping.
Common Web Attacks (OWASP Top 10)
SQL Injection (SQLi): Injecting SQL queries to manipulate databases.
Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): Injecting malicious scripts into web pages.
Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF): Forcing users to perform unwanted actions.
Broken Authentication: Weak login mechanisms lead to unauthorized access.
Security Misconfiguration: Default credentials, open admin panels, unpatched software.
Cookies, Sessions, and Authentication Security
Understanding JWT (JSON Web Tokens), session hijacking, cookie security (HttpOnly, Secure, SameSite).
Web Security Tools
Burp Suite: Intercepts web traffic for testing security.
OWASP ZAP: Open-source web app scanner.
Nikto: Web vulnerability scanner.
